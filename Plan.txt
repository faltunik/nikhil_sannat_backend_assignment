0. Create a new blueprint named teacher and add it in server.py

1. Create TWO API



A. API to get all assignment submitted to particular teacher (GET REQUEST)
    1. In our assignment, model we already have teacher_id,so we can use that to query all assignment submitted to particular teacher
    2. Client need to provide teacher_id(it will be present in our header or payload data)

    1. Client need to provide assignment_id and grade and also user info who is trying to make request
    2. We need a new method to update assignment model
